# Depth First Traversal

This program inputs a graph and performs **depth first traversal** on it using a recursive function.
This program can also handle disconnected graphs.

### Input Format

- First line contains two integers n and m, n being the number of vertices and m being the number of edges in the graph.
- m lines follow each consisting of 2 integers denoting edge between 2 vertices.

### Output Format

- A single line prints out the depth first traversal of the graph.

### Sample Input

```
10 4
1 7 
1 3 
3 5 
2 10 
```

### Sample Output

```
1 7 3 5 2 10 
```

### Implemented In
